-- This should fail because it's invalid to have an `Int` in a kernel context.
-- As it stands, this doesn't even parse because once the parser thinks it's
-- looking at a kernel, it only looks for valid kernel types like `Qubit` and
-- `Bool`. We could probably catch this and make the error message nicer.
